# ✅ Pre-Deployment Work Checklist
## Things You Can Do Right Now (At Work)

---

## 📋 Decision Time (10 minutes)

### 1. Choose Your App Name
Your Streamlit URL will be: `https://YOUR-APP-NAME.streamlit.app`

**Ideas:**
- [ ] `yourname-swim-tracker`
- [ ] `swim-performance-tracker`
- [ ] `yourson-swim-stats`
- [ ] `family-swim-dashboard`
- [ ] Something creative and personal

**Write it here:** ___________________________

---

### 2. Repository Visibility Decision

**Private Repository (Recommended):**
- ✅ Your data stays private
- ✅ Only you see the code
- ✅ Free on GitHub
- ❌ Others can't contribute easily

**Public Repository:**
- ✅ Others can see and learn
- ✅ Open source contribution
- ✅ Good for portfolio
- ❌ Your data might be exposed (need careful .gitignore)

**Your choice:** [ ] Private  [ ] Public

---

### 3. Data Privacy Plan

**What data will you commit to GitHub?**

**ALWAYS commit (safe):**
- [ ] All Python scripts (.py files)
- [ ] Documentation files (.md)
- [ ] requirements.txt
- [ ] standards.json (public USA Swimming data)
- [ ] .gitignore

**TEMPLATE ONLY (no personal data):**
- [ ] goals.csv (empty or example goals)
- [ ] high_school_swims.csv (empty or example swims)

**NEVER commit (personal data):**
- [ ] swim_history.html
- [ ] clean_swim_data.xlsx
- [ ] graded_swim_data.xlsx
- [ ] Any files with real swim times/names

**Your approach:**
- [ ] Commit templates only (recommended)
- [ ] Keep everything local
- [ ] Use separate private data repo
